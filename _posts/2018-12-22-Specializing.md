After taking a few programming courses this semester, as well as TAing a course, I have advanced greatly as a programmer. I also received some advice from an experienced programmer at a BAyPIGgies event that in order to make a career out of programming, one must specialize.

So I picked up some materials on networking and will be taking classes on networking at De Anza College next semester.
