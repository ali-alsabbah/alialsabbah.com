title: This Blog Is Now Hosted on AWS S3
---

After several days of confusion and despair, I've finally gotten this blog up and running using AWS S3, Route 53, and CloudFront. The main benefit at the moment is that it will cost me a third or less of what I was paying for hosting before. Another benefit that will come into play when this blog inevitably has millions of readers, is that it'll scale to meet the demand automatically. Also, issuing SSL certificates was much more straightforward using AWS Certificate Manager.
