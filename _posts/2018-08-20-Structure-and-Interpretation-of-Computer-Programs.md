Today, I started the UC Berkeley <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9">CS 61</a> lecture series based on the legendary <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2w26fu1">*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*</a> book. There is also an excellent HTML/EPUB3 version of the book available <a target="_blank" href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/">here</a>.

I am hoping to strengthen my knowledge of programming fundamentals by completing this set of lectures. This book has been highly recommended online. It is also supposed to be challenging and I am looking forward to a challenge.
