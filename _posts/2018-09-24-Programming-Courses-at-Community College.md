Today is the first day of the fall quarter at Foothill and De Anza Colleges. This semester, I signed up for a few programming courses to help prepare myself for real-world applications of programming. I am taking Introduction to Linux and Python for Programmers. For the most part, I don't think I will learn very many new things in the Linux course, as I'm pretty comfortable using the terminal on my Mac. I am taking it anyways because it will lead into a more advanced shell programming course.

At De Anza, I am taking Beginning Programming Methodologies in C++. Eventually, I'm hoping to get a systems programming certificate as well as a solid understanding of how computers work.
