I always wondered what these signs meant.

I decided to look into it and it turns out that it is a sign from National Fire Protection Association.

For anyone in the future who looks at it and has the same question, I've created an HP-Reveal Aura that'll explain the sign if you point your camera at it. Pointing at it will reveal the following breakdown of the sign.

Here it is in action.
