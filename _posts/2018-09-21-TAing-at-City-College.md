title: TAing at City College
---

Earlier this semester, I became a teaching assistant at City College of San Francisco. The course I am teaching is [CS 110A](https://ccsf.curricunet.com/Report/Course/GetReport/6703?reportId=28){:target="_blank"}, an introduction to programming course with Python as the language of instruction. It has been a mostly positive, but challenging experience. One of the challenges being that I am the most knowledgeable person when it comes to programming and Python in the room.

So far, my duties have consisted of lecturing, designing the course, grading homework, as well as assisting students with their code while in class. Education is something that I am deeply interested in, so this has helped me understand different methods of teaching and what works best for different people.
